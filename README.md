### Creating a Discord Bot

To use this bot in your Discord server, you'll first need to create a Discord bot through the Discord Developer Portal. Follow these steps to get started:

#### Step 1: Create a New Application

1. **Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**.
2. Click on the "New Application" button.
3. Enter a name for your application (e.g., "AI MiniGames Bot") and click "Create".

#### Step 2: Configure Bot Permissions
